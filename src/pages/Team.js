                WeForHealth is a group of youth social activists who care more
                about the life of the people, we are fighting for the change in
                society, thatâ€™s why we brought to you a platform that acts as an
                intermediate between drug & alcohol addicts and
                counselor/therapist to connect in a confidential way. This
                platform also gives room for the testimonies of people who would
                like to share with the community how they were helped by
                therapist and encouraging others to do so.
